# Step 1: Create T0 Logical Router for Enterprise PKS

<details><Summary>Expand to see list of steps for T0 Router installation & configuration</Summary>

- Define a T0 logical switch with an ingress/egress uplink port. Attach the T0 LS to the VLAN Transport Zone.
- Create a logical router port and assign to it a routable CIDR block, for example 10.172.1.0/28, that your environment uses to route to all Enterprise PKS-assigned IP pools and IP blocks.
- Connect the T0 router to the uplink VLAN logical switch.
- Attach the T0 router to the Edge Cluster and set HA mode to Active-Standby. NAT rules are applied on the T0 by NCP. If the T0 router is not set in Active-Standby mode, the router does not support NAT rule configuration.
- Lastly, configure T0 routing to the rest of your environment using the appropriate routing protocol for your environment or by using static routes.

## Step 3: Create NAT Rules for PKS Management and Compute Plane Operations

3.1 The PKS Management  and Compute Plane Networks are deployed to private subnets in the standard Ninja topology (PKS also supports using routed subnets), this requires several NAT rules to be implemented for communications between these isolated private networks and any hosts not directly attached to the subnet, including vCenter and NSX Managers, ESXi Hosts, Jumpboxes & Management hosts. The following steps implement the standard NAT rules used in the Ninja lab environment to enable communications between the PKS Management/Compute Networks and the rest of the lab environment.

To Create a DNAT Rule to enable external access to PKS Management Plane VM's (BOSH Director, Ops Manager, PKS API, Harbor Container Registry), From the `Advanced Networking & Security > Routers` page, click on the `t0-pks` logical router to bring up its details. Click the `Services` Pulldown Menu and select `NAT`. In the NAT pane click `+ADD` and add a DNAT rule with the following parameters:

- On New Nat Rule Screen:
  - Action: `DNAT`
  - Destination IP: `10.40.14.2`
  - Translated IP: `172.31.0.2`
  - Click `ADD`
- On New Nat Rule Screen click `+ADD` and add another rule with the following parameters:
  - Action: `DNAT`
  - Destination IP: `10.40.14.3`
  - Translated IP: `172.31.0.3`
  - Click `ADD` 
- On New Nat Rule Screen click `+ADD` and add another rule with the following parameters:
  - Action: `DNAT`
  - Destination IP: `10.40.14.4`
  - Translated IP: `172.31.0.4`
  - Click `ADD`
- On New Nat Rule Screen click `+ADD` and add another rule with the following parameters:
  - Action: `DNAT`
  - Destination IP: `10.40.14.5`
  - Translated IP: `172.31.0.5`
  - Click `ADD`

## Step 4: Create IP Pools & Blocks needed for PKS

Explanation from the [Documentation]():

```text
Installing VMware Enterprise PKS on vSphere with NSX-T requires the creation of NSX IP blocks for Kubernetes node and pod networks, as well as a Floating IP Pool from which you can assign routable IP addresses to cluster resources.

Create separate NSX-T IP Blocks for the node networks and the pod networks. The subnets for both nodes and pods should have a size of 256 (/16). For more information, see Plan IP Blocks and Reserved IP Blocks.

NODE-IP-BLOCK is used by Enterprise PKS to assign address space to Kubernetes master and worker nodes when new clusters are deployed or a cluster increases its scale.
POD-IP-BLOCK is used by the NSX-T Container Plug-in (NCP) to assign address space to Kubernetes pods through the Container Networking Interface (CNI).

In addition, create a Floating IP Pool from which to assign routable IP addresses to components. This network provides your load balancing address space for each Kubernetes cluster created by Enterprise PKS. The network also provides IP addresses for Kubernetes API access and Kubernetes exposed services. For example, 10.172.2.0/24 provides 256 usable IPs. This network is used when creating the virtual IP pools, or when the services are deployed. You enter this network in the Floating IP Pool ID field in the Networking pane of the Enterprise PKS tile.

```

 4.1 To Create the Pods & Nodes IP Blocks, from the NSX Manager UI Homepage, Navigate to `Advanced Networking & Security > IPAM` and click `+ADD` to add an IP block with the following values:

- Name: `ip-block-nodes-deployments`
- CIDR: `172.15.0.0/16`
- Click `Save`
- Click `+ADD` to add an additional IP Address Block
- Name: `ip-block-pods-deployments`
- CIDR: `172.16.0.0/16`
- Click `Save`

4.2 To create the floating IP Pool for Kubernetes Load Balancer Virtual IP Addresses,  in the NSX Manager UI navigate to `Advanced Networking & Security > Inventory > Groups` page and click on the `IP Pools` tab. Click `+ADD` and add an IP Pool with the following parameters:

- Name: `ip-pool-vips`
- Click `Add` under Subnets
- IP Range: `10.40.14.34-10.40.14.62`
- Gateway: `10.40.14.33`
- CIDR: `10.40.14.32/27`
- DNS Servers: `192.168.110.10`
- DNS Suffix: `corp.local`
- Click **Add**
